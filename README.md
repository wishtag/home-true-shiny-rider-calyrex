A simple texture mod for Pokémon Home that makes Sinistea's and Polteageist's Antique forms, Poltchageist's Artisan form, and Sinistcha's Masterpiece form easier to tell apart from their Phony, Counterfeit, and Unremarkable forms.  

To my knowledge, these are official renders created for Pokémon Home, but just went unused. These renders were sourced from [Bulbapedia/Bulbagarden](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:HOME_artwork).  

Before installing, **make sure the release is compatible with the current version of Pokémon Home.**  

I've tested this myself on my own Pokémon Home account, so you shouldn't get banned for using it. However, if you do get banned, I take no responsibility; that's on you.
